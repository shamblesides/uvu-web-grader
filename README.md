# UVU Web Grader
This was part of some work that my university's web professor hired me to do.
Some of his other students had previously created a web app that let users
submit code to a server, which would automatically do linting before accepting
the submission.

The original authors didn't put the project on GitHub, so the initial commit
is the project dumped in its original state.

Currently unfinished; will probably be finding someone else to maintain it soon.
